# Decoding the past: deep learning for macroevolutionary analyses

Understanding how biodiversity has changed through geological time and which mechanisms mediate the uneven extinction and diversification of species are central challenges in paleobiology. Deep learning is a powerful tool to estimate past biodiversity and exploring the different factors that could drive dynamics. We present two new methods based on deep learning:
 
1. birth-death neural networks (BDNN) in PyRate for exploring the differential effects of abiotic and biotic variables on the diversification rates of extinct species without the necessity to include phylogenies in the model, and
2. DeepDive for estimating past biodiversity from fossil occurrence data incorporating spatial, taxonomic and temporal biases.
